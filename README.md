# Numerical Differential Equations

Numerical Differential Equations is a field of mathematics that deals with the numerical approximation of solutions to differential equations. Differential equations are used to model various real-world phenomena such as the motion of objects, the spread of disease, and the behavior of financial markets.

Numerical Differential Equations can be divided into two main categories: **initial value problems** and **boundary value problems**. Initial value problems involve finding the solution of a differential equation at a single point, given the value of the function and its derivative at that point. Boundary value problems involve finding the solution of a differential equation over a range of values, subject to boundary conditions.

In this repository, I covered some numerical methods for solvng ODEs that have their own advantages and disadvantages over one another, according to the problem we are trying to solve.

**Covered Methods:**

- Adams
- Euler
- Taylor
- Runge-Kutta (order 2)
- Runge-Kutta (order 4)

## Applications

Numerical Differential Equations has numerous applications in science, engineering, and finance. Some of the most common applications include:

- Modeling physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetic fields.
- Predicting the spread of diseases and epidemics.
- Designing and optimizing engineering systems such as bridges, airplanes, and vehicles.
- Analyzing and predicting financial markets.

## Conclusion

By developing and analyzing algorithms for solving differential equations numerically, Numerical Differential Equations helps us to better understand and model real-world phenomena.

This repository is specifically focusing on the implementation of numerical methods for solving ODEs using **MATLAB**.
